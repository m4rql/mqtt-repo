![img](./img/system2.gif)

This is a project made for the Internet of Things class at the Sapienza University of Rome. It is maded of two components:
* **Environmental Station**: It is a cloud-based IoT system that collects information from a set of virtual environmental sensors using the MQTT, MQTT-SN, and LoRaWAN protocol and displays it in a simple web site dashboard.
* **User Activity Recognition**: HTML5 crowd sensing application that, using the Generic Sensor API, collects data from the accelerator sensor of the mobile phone and  predict the activity of the user: Still or Moving.

The MQTT is managed using the cloud-based backend of the Google IoT Core platform.

Technology used: Python, C, RIOT-OS, MQTT-SN, LoRaWAN, Node.js, MQTT, WebSockets, MongoDB, JQuery, Bootstrap CSS and HTML, Generic Sensor API.
